Hello, my name is Jon Vines. I am a software engineer living and working in Manchester for [Vodafone](http://vodafone.co.uk).

I have been plying my trade for nearly ten years now. I've learned lots along the way but never really taking a step back to reflect or write down some of the things I've learned. This blog is an attempt to start to do that.

Below is a list of some of the things I'm interested in, and will be posting about moving forward:

* Software development - perhaps quite obvious, but particularly looking at architectural patterns to support the practices of [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/). Also taking a look at [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and its practical application within the software delivery lifecycle through the use of design patterns.
* [Lean engineering](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh533841(v=vs.120).aspx) - continous improvement as both an individual, team and organisation is critical to delivering good products when they are needed, which is often very quickly.
* DevOps - [visualising the work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping), collaboration across the organisation and the automated delivery of software. What's not to like?
* Leading teams - I've formally lead software development teams as a technical lead for two years and it can often be a bumpy road. I'll be taking a look at some strategies for keeping teams effective and motivated to do the work.
